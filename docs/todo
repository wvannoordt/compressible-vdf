[x] Write a global function to convert between node/face/cell indices to standardize convention
[ ] Separate out the block topology type to handle neighbor relationships and domain boundary status
[ ] Better separation of navier-stokes code and the general finite-volume framework code
[ ] Flux compatibility concepts
[ ] Fix the segfault issue with the MPI communicator when not using MPI_COMM_WORLD
[ ] Fix some of the silly nonsense present in the dual-time integration scheme
[ ] Organize the 'core' directory a bit more sensibly
[ ] More lightweight implementation of the time-integration schemes - less mechanistic framework. The schemes themselves are conceptual.
[ ] Variadic flux implementation -- union of the flux information and remove indexing for the retrieval of the flux info (index based on type!)
[x] README
[ ] Infer grid dimension from the dimension of arrays passed to constructor?
