[x] Write a global function to convert between node/face/cell indices to standardize convention
[ ] Separate out the block topology type to handle neighbor relationships and domain boundary status
[x] Better separation of navier-stokes code and the general finite-volume framework code
[ ] Flux compatibility concepts
[ ] Fix the segfault issue with the MPI communicator when not using MPI_COMM_WORLD
[x] Fix some of the silly nonsense present in the dual-time integration scheme
[x] Organize the 'core' directory a bit more sensibly
[x] More lightweight implementation of the time-integration schemes - less mechanistic framework. The schemes themselves are conceptual.
[x] Variadic flux implementation -- union of the flux information and remove indexing for the retrieval of the flux info (index based on type!)
[x] README
[x] Infer grid dimension from the dimension of arrays passed to constructor?
[x] Move mtimer_t to the timing namespace
[x] Simplify the array-type index system (probably just use a struct!)
[x] Make the indexing more efficient for memory maps (don't create temporary arrays!)
[x] Separate the block indexing from the block element indexing
[x] CRTP for basic array types
[ ] Improve the implementation of the md_loop algorithm to be able to use any kind of index
[ ] re-write range and md_iterator to use literal-constant indexing
[ ] Implement CUDA kernel version of md_loop
[x] Implement tiling map for use with OpenMP/thread pooling
[ ] Remove all traces of old memory map implementation
[ ] Rewrite io namespace to use new memory mapping
[ ] Rewrite exchange function to use new memory mapping
[ ] Develop OMNI system
[ ] Boundary conditions in pde_algs
[ ] Re-work the coordinate systems to have transforms etc. as member functions
[ ] Introduce and omni-info for interpolated value with specified order-of-accuracy
[ ] Re-work the lambda-omni conversion to account for unions
